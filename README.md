# Brainfuck Interpreter written in Assembly
Fully working interpreter for the Brainfuck language written in GAS x86-x64 Assembly language. This project was made as a bonus assignment for university, in collaboration with another classmate (Victor Vorona). This code is not optimized at all as it is beyond the scope of my intentions. </br>
The file can be compiled using: gcc -no-pie -o bf brainfuck.s</br>
Usage: ./<name_of_program> <name_of_file> </br>
Usage example: ./bf mandelbrot.b
